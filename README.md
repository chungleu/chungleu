# Hi, I'm Chung :v:

I'm a software engineer and consultant passionate about using technology to share, build, then scale ideas to make the world a better place.
Some tech I enjoy working with includes Node, React, and Python for Data Science (TensorFlow and Keras)

Unfortunately this is only a space for my personal projects. Most of which are knowledge-sharing materials for technical communities I contribute to. That or ML models and DS tools I'm tinkering with.

My work-ier projects aren't allowed on regular GitHub :speak_no_evil: But I promise they're cool :sunglasses:
